Registration
----------------

We don't have registration. We are sure that users have a GitHub account because the site is very tied to GitHub. We use GitHub authorization.
We also don't have any user data like name or location because the main profile for our users is their GitHub profile.

Npm module dependencies
-------------------------

* ``tether``, ``jquery`` and ``popper.js`` are ``bootstrap`` dependencies
* ``node-sass`` is a dependency of ``sass-loader``
* ``less`` is a dependency of ``less-loader`` which is a dependency of ``font-awesome-webpack``
